# Machine-Intelligence-SoC
#### SoC Project_Introduction to Machine Intelligence_By Prithvi Chauhan

#### Week 1
Learnt about Python and using Jupyter Notebook. <br>
Python Resources : https://github.com/Python-is-Cool-Kids/PyCK-2021 <br>
<br>
Completed **Basics of Python I & II**
* Covering Variables, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Various Operators, <br>
Control Flow, Loops, Functions, Comprehensions, and a lot about Strings

#### Week 2
Continued with **Python Libraries** <br>
**Numpy** and **Pandas** from the same Py-Ck Course (https://github.com/Python-is-Cool-Kids/PyCK-2021) <br>
Learnt about **Git and Github Fundamentals** <br>
Links : 
* https://youtu.be/DVRQoVRzMIY</li>
* https://youtu.be/USjZcfj8yxE</li>

Covering things like commiting changes, concept of branches, and <br>
various other git commands, remote repositories etc.<br>
<br>
Started with **Neural Networks** <br>
* Had a Basic Introduction of what Neural Networks are, Binary Classification, <br>
Computational Graphs of Neural Networks, Activation Functions like *Sigmoid*, <br>
*ReLU* & *Leaky ReLU* and their respective advantages in different scenarios. <br>
Learnt NN Notations, why *Non Linear Activation Functions* are better to be used <br>
and Implementation of Gradient Descent for Neural Networks.

#### Week 3 & Week 4
Continued with **Neural Networks** <br>
* Learnt Forward and Backward Propagation and Weight Initialization. <br>
* Had a brief on Deep Neural Networks, training & testing them. Learnt <br>
about Bias/Variance, Regularization - Dropout & other methods, Early stopping <br>
and model Ensembeles.
* Got to know the need of normalizing Inputs. Learnt what are vanishing and <br>
exploding gradients, Weight Initialization for Deep NNs, how to optimize algorithms<br>
via various methods.
* Learnt what are the various hyperparameters, their tuning, Batch Normalization<br>
& Programming frameworks
* Lastly, studied about Softmax Regression
* CNNs and RNNs were also intoduced this week, & also made a small CNN project on <br>
**Digit Recognization** using Tensorflow with its code attached:- <br>

#### Week 5

This week we started with *Reinforcement Learning* & *Q Learning* and its <br>
implementation in python.<br>
Learnt about various types of RL, Model based & Model free methods. <br>
Learnt about Markov Decision Processes, Temporal Differnces & the *Bellmann* <br>
*Equation*

#### Week 6

We studied about *Open AI Gym Environment* and also implemented Reinforcement <br>
Learning in various Gym environments like *Acrobat v1* and *Frozen Lake* 

#### Week 7

We were intorduced to *Deep Q Networks* <br>
Learnt about Experience Replay & some Action-Selection Policies. <br>

##### Also Started with the Final Poject......Week 8 & 9 :)

### Thanks a lot to my mentors **Azim & Tanmay** who guided me throuhout my project and helped me learn so much <3
